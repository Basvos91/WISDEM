    "Here's what we've done so far in these tutotirals:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Ran two simple cost models of turbines. In these, we estiamted masses of components and cost per kilogram of those components.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We learned how OpenMDAO makes *components* when we calculated the Betz limit by modelling an idealized `ActuatorDisc` as a subclass of `ExplicitComponent`\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We learned how to group multiple components into groups with the OpenMDAO `Group` class when we modelled the Sellar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now turn our attention back to WISDEM and put together a rotor, drivetrain and tower to model a complete wind turbine. We will use the tools we have gained so far in these tutorials to accomplish this."
