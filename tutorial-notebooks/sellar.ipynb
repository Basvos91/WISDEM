    "# The Sellar Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have seen quick applications of WISDEM for to run a cost and scaling model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we used OpenMDAO to study the Betz limit and find the maximum power that can be captured by an idealized rotor. There, we declared partial derivatives and provided analytical solutions to those derivatives and allowed OpenMDAO to optimize our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Betz problem used just one `ActuatorDisc` component. In real applications of WISDEM, we will need to optimize with multiple components. This tutorial will show how to assemble multiple components in OpenMDAO. From there there, our next step will return to WISDEM to assemble a wind turbine in code.\n",

    "## Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) terminology and XDSM diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "MDO has some key terms and visual diagram format called XDSM to describe optimization setups. There are couple resources to learn the basics that could be helpful. The entirety of these articles are a good reference, but there are a few key sections that have information we'll use in this demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Problem formulation section of multidisciplinary design optimization on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_design_optimization#Problem_formulation): Read the definitions for *design variables*, *constraints*, *objectives* and *models*.\n",

    "- [Lambe and Martins: Extensions to the Design Strcuture Matrix for the Description of Multidisciplinary Desgn, Analysis, and Optimation Processes](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/extensions-design-structure-matrix): Read section 2 \"Terminology and Notation\" for further explanation of *design variables*, *discipline analysis*, *response variables*, *target variables* and *coupling variables*. Read section 4 about XDSM diagrams that dsecribe MDO processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the OpenMDAO documentation at [Sellar - A Two-Discipline Problem with a Nonlinear Solver](http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/latest/basic_guide/sellar.html). The aim of this tutorial is to summarize the key points you'll use to create basic WISDEM models.\n",

    "So those are the components. So far in our lessons, we have used `om.ExplicitComponent` for our models. Now, we need more classes to group multiple components (our Discipline 1 and 2) with an objective function, constraints and connect all the variables correctly.. To do this we'll use more OpenMDAO classes. There is [more detail in the OpenMDAO docuemntation](http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/latest/basic_guide/sellar.html), but here are the highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Group`: The OpenMDAO `om.Group` class allows you to cluster models in hierarchies. We can put multiple components in groups. We can also put other groups in groups. By creating groups you can create assemblies of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ExecComp`: This is a great solution for making an equation for a constraint or objective without building out an entire component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NonlinearBlockGS`: This is one of the many solvers in OpenMDAO. It is a non-linear solver that we'll use to optimize our disciplines as a subgroup before we optimize the rest of the sytem around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few of the highlights from the source code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Promoting variables of the same name connects them\n",
    "\n",
    "When you promote an output from a component, it is connected to the inputs of the same name within the same subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design variables added as outputs from an `IndepVarComp` component:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "indeps = self.add_subsystem('indeps', om.IndepVarComp(), promotes=['*'])\n",
    "indeps.add_output('x', 1.0)\n",
    "indeps.add_output('z', np.array([5.0, 2.0]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### A cycle that interconnects our discipline components\n",
    "\n",
    "For solving the Sellar system, it is useful to iteratively converge the discipline components first, and then calcualte the rest of the model. We do this by making a subgroup that holds our discipline components and giving them a solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cycle = self.add_subsystem('cycle', om.Group(), promotes=['*'])\n",
    "cycle.add_subsystem('d1', SellarDis1(), promotes_inputs=['x', 'z', 'y2'],\n",
    "                    promotes_outputs=['y1'])\n",
    "cycle.add_subsystem('d2', SellarDis2(), promotes_inputs=['z', 'y1'],\n",
    "                    promotes_outputs=['y2'])\n",
    "cycle.nonlinear_solver = om.NonlinearBlockGS()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ExecComp` is handy for turning smple equations into components\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the following snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.add_subsystem('con_cmp2', om.ExecComp('con2 = y2 - 24.0'), promotes=['con2', 'y2'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickly creates a component for constraint 2. The other constraint and the objective are coded similarly.\n",
