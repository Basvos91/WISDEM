================================

.. TODO: expand this

We share the basic workflow for contributing code for WISDEM.
It'll probably involve:

- Writing code to introduce a bugfix or feature
- Adding tests for that new code and any other affected code
- Adding documentation for the relevant functionality affected
- Submitting a PR on the WISDEM repo
