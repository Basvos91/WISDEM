WISDEM capabilities
===================

Previous sections in the documentation have focused on :ref:`how_wisdem_works` at a high-level without delving into WISDEM's modeling assumptions and coding implementation.
This page covers some of those details, explains when to use WISDEM versus other software packages, and where WISDEM's capabilities start and stop.

What WISDEM can do
------------------

overview

individual modules and combinations of them

the general assumptions that go into the analyses

computational timing

do I show a table of the problems that have been solved? and link to papers? that'd be cool


What WISDEM Cannot Do
---------------------

can't do time accurate simulations

tower limitations

other individual discipline limitations

can't be a push-button solution for designing wind turbines
