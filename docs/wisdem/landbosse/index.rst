Capital costs associated with building land-based wind power plants
*******************************************************************

Capital costs associated with constructing a land-based wind power plant include turbine capital costs, transportation cost, and balance-fo-system cost. They are outline in Table 1 below.

What capital costs does LandBOSSE model?
****************************************

The Land-based Balance-of-System Systems Engineering (LandBOSSE) model is a systems engineering tool that estimates the balance-of-system (BOS) costs associated with installing utility scale land-based wind plants (10, 1.5 MW turbines or larger). The methods used to develop this model and a detailed discussion of its inputs and outputs are in the following report.

LandBOSSE and OpenMDAO
**********************

In WISDEM, LandBOSSE is presented as an OpenMDAO ``Group`` called ``LandBOSSE``. This group wraps an ``ExplicitComponent`` called ``LandBOSSE_API``. When using LandBOSSE in assemblies, LandBOSSE should be accessed via the ``LandBOSSE`` group.

LandBOSSE Inputs
****************

The ``LandBOSSE`` group takes input from a mix of continuous floating point values, discrete integers, and discrete dataframes. The dataframes are read from a ``.xlsx`` spreadsheet which contains the lookup tables with information about cranes, labor rates, and many more data needed to calculate balance-of-system costs.

Modules
*******

Costs calculated in LandBOSSE are in eight modules. Four modules (erection, foundation, site preparation, and collection) are process based and calcualte costs based on models of physical processes that happen to accomplish the scope of work defined for each module. The other four modules (management, grid connection, substation, and development) are based on curve fits from empirical data.
