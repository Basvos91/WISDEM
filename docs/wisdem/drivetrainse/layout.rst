Direct-Drive Layout
---------------------

The overall layout for the direct-drive configuration is shown in :numref:`fig_layout_pic` and :numref:`fig_layout_diagram`.  The hub connects to the low-speed shaft, which is a large diameter, hollow cylinder supported by two sets of main bearings attached to the nose, also called the turret.  The nose is affixed to the bedplate, which also has a circular cross-section, but follows an elliptical curve down to the tower attachment.  The total length, parallel to the ground, from the tower center line to the rotor apex, is considered the *overhang*.  The total height difference between those same two points in the *drive height*.  The outer-rotor of the generator also attaches to the low-speed shaft, and the corresponding stator attaches to the nose.
