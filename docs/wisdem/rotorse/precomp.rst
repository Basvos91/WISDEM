PreComp
------
PreComp :cite:`Bir2005` implements a modified classic laminate theory with a shear-flow approach and it is based on shell elements. PreComp offers the attractive advantages of running almost instantaneously and not requiring sophisticated meshing routines. However, PreComp suffers the limitation that it does not estimate the shear stiffness terms. In addition, the other stiffness and inertia terms suffer inaccuracies compared to three dimensional finite element models :cite:`precompvs3D`.

Readers interested to know more about PreComp should refer to the PreComp User Guide, which is available here `https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/38929.pdf <https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/38929.pdf>`_
